- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Martina, I've studied statistics, with experience in market research and,  a beginner in the field of information technology. More specifically, I would like to get good hold of knowledge of the front-end web development now as hopefully, in a few months, I would like to look for a job in this field.
- ðŸ‘€ I came across Czechitas, a non-profit governmental organisation in Prague, the Czech Republic, and at the moment, IÂ´m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React in an intensive three-month Digital Web Academy.
- ðŸ‘€ During our studies, we are strongly encouraged to use GitHub, and as we have our regular homework, I created a repository called 'piskvorky' to which I week by week add my work. The successive assignments are in repositories 'Ukol-Piskvorky_1' and further on.
- ðŸ“« If you would like to contact me about anything, or review my code and give me some tips how to do it in a better way, my e-mail is martina.korandova.praha@gmail.com.
